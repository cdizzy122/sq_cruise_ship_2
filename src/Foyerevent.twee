Heeeyyyy man, what are you up to?!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Uumm nothing, just woke up.<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Dude, that's a fucked up schedule if I've ever seen one, hahaha
Hey listen, maybe I'm a little too late, but if I remember correctly, it's going to be your guys' anniversary, and I've got a little present for you. <</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh, you really shouldn't have...<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Shut up! We've known each other for how much? 6 years?! I've never given you a big present, not even on your birthdays! hahahaha
Just let me do this. Why don't you meet me at the park and then I'll take it from there?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well...ok.<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
I'm already here, but I can wait if you need some time.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Fine, I'll go as soon as I can!<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Nice, see you there!<</speech>>
