<<if ndef $sms2>><<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Hiiii, how are you doing, baby? Did you think of what we talked about last time?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Yes. I gave it a few thoughts and I think that I love you, like REALLY love you. And I want you to be happy, even when I'm not there. I understand that you have your needs...<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
OMG $name, you've just made me so happy. I'm so relieved that you do understand. $gffname said that you wouldn't understand, but she was wrong!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
So how is everything going then?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Are you trying to ask me about my sexual life?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
I, I guess...?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Do you really want to know? You may not like it.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Um...I'm not sure, but I think I prefer to be updated. Maybe not too much detail...<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Well then! I'm going to tell you everything! I knew you would like it. Did I ever introduce you to my David?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Um...David who?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
My ex, stupid! Hahaha Anyway, the last weekend he texted me, as he usually does.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Usually?!<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
C'mon, don't make such a big deal of it. He writes me from time to time, but I never really reply. He sends me pics and all...<</speech>> 
<<linkappend "see?">>

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
What the fuck?! Is he sending you nudes every fucking week? Do you answer him?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Yeah, he does... he always says that he wants a piece of my ass. And you can thank me that I put the heart-censor on the pic 'cause there wasn't one... I don't want you to feel even worse, baby...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
So the pic was a full nude?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Exactly. Do you want to see it then?<</speech>>

<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Don't be mad baby. He is such an asshole, so selfish and dumb. I wouldn't be his girlfriend ever again.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well...ok then, I trust you. But please, honey, erase those pictures.<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Why?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Why?! Because he is trying to hit on you and you just said you are not interested.<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Yeah, but...he is trying to be nice, in his own way. Taking those selfies takes some time, it's like a present to me. I don't want to destroy his presents.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
You keep all of them?!<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
No... well, yes, but...

Oops, he just sent me a video...<</speech>>

No. I don't. And you shouldn't be accepting this guy's nudes!<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Well, E.X.C.U.S.E.M.E. He is just showing how much he cares for me in his own way. At least he makes me feel liked.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Are you saying I don't care about you?! That is so unfair. This "David" is trying to get his dick wet and you are letting him.<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Well, if you really cared so much about me you would try and talk to me more often. Plus, we haven't had sex for a long time...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well, yeah. We are having some problems, but we will try and work it out. This guy has nothing to do with what we do. He should not be a part of this.<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Don't talk like that about him! He's being really sweet to me. And that's my ex you're talking about, he is not just some "guy"!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
He knew you had a boyfriend and he is sending you these pics. That's not a very manly thing to do, he's a prick!<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
I think he has you beat in manliness, you low selfsteem coward! I don't even know why I bother talking to you, you always do shit. You're jealous about everything!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
What do you mean he's got me beat! You are my girlfriend, for christ's sake!<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
This is what I mean, asshole!

... ... ...<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Are you happy now?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well, no. I'm actually disappointed...<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
It's not me who is sending the pictures! And you have to admit that he's kind of pleasing to watch.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
What do you mean?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
C'mon, you know what I mean... he's tall and muscly... and his size... You've got to admit that his body is amazing. I guess you have reason to be jealous.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Are you saying that you prefer him to me?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Well...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
This is unbelievable!<</speech>>

<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Baby, you are being unreasonable. Stop talking, I'm busy.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(I bet she's talking to that guy... Fuck!)<</speech>>

$gfname?! What's going on? Are you talking with him?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
No, baby. I'm just... doing dinner and can't type.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
I can see you are online, $gfname...<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Are you spying on me or what?!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
No, but we were talking and then you just-<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Stop, just stop...ugh! don't be so paranoid... I'm tired, I'm going to bed.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Didn't you say you were making dinner?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Whatever! Stop talking now, I'm busy...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
This is incredible...<</speech>>
You keep looking at the "online" mark below her name for a few minutes.

It isn't even flinching. 

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(She just doesn't want to talk to me. I bet she is talking with him. She just said he was an asshole...)<</speech>>
After a few more minutes you look away from the phone and massage your eyes. This is maing you feel bad... 

<span class="onomatopeya">*BING*</span>

She just sent you a whatsapp:

<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
//''*This message was deleted.*''//<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Did you just deleted the whatsapp? What was it?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Nothing, baby. Just wasn't for you.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
But what was it?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Nothing important, just a selfie for the...girls.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well... send it to me. I miss you so much, you know?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
You know how to win my heart. Hm...ok baby :) here it is:<</speech>>
<img src="gf/gfass.gif" width="70%">

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Honey... you don't seem tired. And do you usually send an ass-selfie to your girlfriends?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Of course! Stop being so dramatic! I thought that you would appreciate the pic and maybe say something nice to me for a change. But I was wrong... Now, stop talking. I'm busy talking to someone who really CARES about my pic.<</speech>>
You stop talking so you don't make things any worse, but you know she is talking to that David guy.

She is still "online" so you try to change the topic of conversation:

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Ok, honey. Have a good night. I loved your pic, by the way.<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Shhhhh.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Oh, man...)<</speech>>
[[Bedroom|$return][$smsm2 to false]]<</timed>>
<<elseif $sms2 is 4>><<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
I don't like this...<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Oh, honey! It's all fun. I already told you, I don't love him even remotely as much as I do you.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well, thanks for saying that...<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
So do you want to see the video?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
I really don't need to see it.<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Well, ok. It's just for the laugh, honey. And you wanted to see the selfie one, so I thought that you were kind of into it...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Into what? Guys?!<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
I didn't say that, you said it. I just meant that we could have fun together laughing at how douchy he is.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh... yeah, sure. But don't show me the pictures. I can get jealous...<</speech>>
...

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
$gfname?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
I'm here. I'm just replying to him.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Why do you even reply!?<</speech>>
...

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
$gfname!<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Shhhh! Don't be like this, ok? You didn't want to be part of the fun, so don't be jealous now.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
But you said that he was an asshole!<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
Ok honey, stop.<</speech>>
You can see her status is "online".

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(This is embarrasing... she is obviously talking to that "David" guy...)<</speech>>
