Hi. Here's a pic, as I figure you will be missing me. Going away for so long...
Look $name, I am not going to lie to you: I am not happy about us. This might be the perfect time for both of us to think. Think about our lives and our relationship. Maybe...maybe this is a sign.

That doesn't mean that I want to stop talking to you. I still love you, $name. I just think we need some time. 

Anyway, you've got me here if you feel alone or if you miss me. I...I guess we are not officialy together, so we can see other people, though that doesn't mean I will. I'm going to miss you. 

Try to be happy there and have fun.

PS: If you treat me well I might be sending more pics ;)<</speech>>

\\<<elseif $setcuckpath is 0>>Well, this is proof that things COULD get worse... At least she seems to be taking it pretty well...

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(I wasn't expecting such comprehension of her, especially considering how angry she was at me last night) Ok baby, I understand. Take care, I love you. <3<3<</speech>>
Although you have lots of questions for her, you decide it's best to swallow your pride and do your best to forget about it.

With an unsettling feeling in your guts, you decide to get in bed and try to <<click "sleep" "Goodmorning">><<set $receivemessages to true>><<widget showday>>Day <<print $dayn>><</widget>><<set $dayn to 0>><<adddays 1>><</click>><<set $gfsms to 0>><<set $announcement2 to true>><<audio "menus" stop>>





\\<<elseif $setcuckpath is 1>>Thinking about swallowing your pride just makes you angrier. You know this has crossed a line you weren't expecting it to...

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Maybe it's better for us to be apart after all...) Yeah, I'm not happy either. We totally should break up, especially after knowing I can't trust you. Heh... I bet you send lewd pics to everyone else, but I'm just receiving a lame selfie?<</speech>>
<<speech "gfd" "''$gfname:''">>
You are being unfair and you know it! Those were old pictures and you weren't supposed to know of their existence.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Whatever, I just don't feel I can trust you, so I think being apart is a great idea. We'll talk about the house and everything else once I'm back.<</speech>>
You see her writing back, but her message never arrives. It seems like she's given up.
