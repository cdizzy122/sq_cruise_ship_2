Hey mate! How are you doing? I'm at the stores right now.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh, hey, I'm fine. How are you? What are you buying?<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Oh, nothing, just a couple of things I needed. I just wanted to ask you if you'd recommend that neighbour of yours.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
My neigh- oh, you mean $gffname?<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Yep, just wanted to ask you, because, well... I've got a match!<</speech>>

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh... well, I think she's... (a bitch...)<</speech>>
Even though you're kind of happy for $fname, you are still kind of scared of $gffname.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(She could easily send him my picture or tell him about all that embarrasing stuff... this is awful!) I don't really think you should mess around with her...<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Dude, have you seen her? I am going to pound that, that's for sure man...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Agh...) Well, okay, but I think you should go easy with her. She's kind of a bitch, you know?<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Hm, I'll take that into consideration.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
... which means you don't care.<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Hahahaha You know me, man!<</speech>>
You see him going offline.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Fuck...)<</speech>>

<div class="center"><img src="lana/tinder2.jpg" width="30%"></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Yeah, he just told me that he found you as well...<</speech>>
<<speech "lanad" "''$gffname:''">>
Oooh, really? And did he say nice things about me?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Look, why don't you talk to him and-<</speech>>

Wow, dude... she's actually around the stores as well and we're going to meet in a while!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
... ... (Fuck...)<</speech>>
You don't like this a bit, but if $gffname keeps her mouth shut about you, you really don't care that much about $fname having fun with her.

You let the phone go for a while.

Wow! Hahaha WTF!<</speech>>

Yeah, and you, $name? Do you like that?<</speech>>
You are too weirded out by the situation, and so you decide it's better to stay quiet.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
... ...<</speech>>
<<speech "lanad" "''$gffname:''">>
Hah! I bet he's jacking off... Come here, $fname, let's have some more fun around here! If you behave, I'll even help you out with that bulge I'm seeing...<</speech>>
