Hey, $name! How's it going over there!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh, hey $fname! As fine as it can go, really. The ship is... really nice, but I'm still occasionally thinking about $gfname...<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Yeah, I bet... but hey, at least you're in a fucking Cruise Ship with free drinks! You're welcome mate... hahaha<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Hahaha... (Maybe I could tell him about what's going on on this Ship!)<</speech>>

As you write it, just before you have the chance to send it, you start to see some of the words pop-up in red and reduce in size until they're erased from the text, leaving it as: "$fname, please, listen to me! This Ship is filled with women that only want to fuck!".

 *SEND*

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(WTF! That's not what I wanted to send!)<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Wow... Hahahaha okay, bud, I get it! Well then I guess you owe me one, huh? üòÇüòÇ I'm relieved to see you having so much fun in there, really. I've got to go now, but I'll get back to you as soon as I can ü§üüèª<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(*sigh* Okay...) Okay, talk to you, $fname.<</speech>>
As you see $fname go offline, you start trying typing some more lines.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
<font size="-2"><span class="red">Size Queen, trapped, Cruise...</span></font><</speech>>
As you see your message dissapear again, you are now certain that Captain T is somehow manipulating the phone she gave you.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(I'm fucked...)<</speech>>

What else are you telling me then? *psst* Any "nice ladies" over there?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Yeah, it's actually filled with "ladies"...<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
ü§£ Bro, listen to yourself. You're writing that as if it was a torture. You know that most guys would give a liver to be in a Ship with a lot of women?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Yeah, I guess so... haha... I-I have had an encounter with one of them, you know...<</speech>>
<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
No shit? That's my man! Did you put that bitch on all fours?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Um, no. I didn't have a chance, or... I just... I guess I don't remember...<</speech>>
You cringe as you send that last message. You really don't want to tell him that much about that encounter with Tara.

<<speech "mike" "''$fname:''">>
Hahaha sound like fun! I bet the inauguration party rocked. Anyway man, I've got to go now, alright? Keep having fun!<</speech>>
