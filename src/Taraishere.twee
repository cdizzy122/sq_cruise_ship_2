<<removeclass "html">><<addclass "html" "library">><<if ndef $taralibrary>>Tara is here, reading a book on a table.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Well, look who it is...
<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Um...hi. I'm sorry about last night-
<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
I haven't been so disappointed in a long time. You better be sorry.
<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
... ... *You lower your head, not knowing what to say*
<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Hahaha... it's alright, honey. I'm not that mad anymore. But you have to make it up to me. I don't think you understand how much women are repressed in their sexuality. *Closes the book* I think Captain's idea is going to help you understand. I will be monitoring your lessons and reviewing your performance every friday. We'll start with a simple assignment:

''Take a selfie with a girl.''<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Uhh... ok.<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
BUT! She has to choose between ''kissing you'' or ''laughing at you''.
Send it to me by the end of the day or you will fail. And you don't want to make me mad, do you?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
No...<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Good. *smiles* Bye-bye!<</speech>>
 ''*Quest Available at QuestLog*''

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Hahahahaha! That must have been so embarrasing! It must be hard knowing that all the girls in this boat know about your little friend, huh?<</speech>>
You don't know what to answer. In part you are embarrased, but you also feel sorry because you couldn't satisfy Tara...

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Yes...<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Well, I hope you now understand that it's not that I hate you. It's just that I wasn't expecting you to be like...this *She puts her pinkie up* But I actually think you are kinda cute, I mean, I liked you last night at the party.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
... *your cheeks are getting red* ...<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Don't be shy, $name. I promise that if you behave well, I will be nice to you. Just like best friends... with benefits. What do you say?<</speech>>
That's the nicest thing anyone has told you since you got on this ship.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Um... ok.<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Nice. *smiles* I'm glad we got to fix things. You can go now. Oh! And, $name... has anyone ever told you you've got a very nice ass for a guy? *winks*<</speech>>
