Your tummy aches just by the thought of what you are going to find inside those folders.

You can't help but stare at the massive dong of this latino boy. You know he must be young, but that dick belongs to a horse...

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Who took those pictures of him in the shower?? Could it be... $gfname...?<</speech>>

Even if $gfname's face is not on any picture, you think you are recognizing that ass...

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(For real? Is that her?? Oh, and David...)<</speech>>
You remember her talking to you a long time ago about her ex David.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(That must be THAT David... I can't believe this! Why is she keeping these pictures!?)<</speech>>
You can feel a knot growing in your stomach, especially now that you're seeing the great difference between you both.

As you go on, you feel like you're not going to be able to watch any more of this.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(I still can't understand why the FUCK she's storing these pictures!)<</speech>>
Your insecurity is only growing bigger and bigger as you see more... but you keep scrolling down...
