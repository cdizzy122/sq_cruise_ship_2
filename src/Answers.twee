Why am I here? How could a guy have gotten into an only women ship?
<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
That's a good question...Hmm...
<</speech>>
You swear you can see smoke comming off her head.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
The only way that you could have gotten in here is if someone from the organization had put your name into the program...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Yeah, I remember the woman in the travel agency putting me in...<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
No! But I don't think an agency worker can do that without higher authorization. The system won't let it...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Wow... that was... useful! Thank you, Anastasia. How do you know so much about the system though?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
I programmed it, you dummy! hehe<</speech>>

So... do you like dancing?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Oh, yeah! It's always been my dream to be a pole dancer... I used to work for the company, but I got fed up with all that boring work, so I just asked daddy to let me work in the ship! It's so much more fun!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well... I am happy that you're happy.<</speech>>

Ohh... that's so sweet... *She strongly hugs you*<</speech>>
Her strong body feels like a huge snake all around your neck. It's almost choking you.

What's on Deck 1?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Oooh... you're a curious cat, aren't you? hehe... Well, I really shouldn't tell you, Captain orders.

But...

I can tell you that it is only accesible through the elevator and you need one of the staff's cards to activate it. Hehe, it's actually an engine room, but... Oh! I talk too much!!<</speech>>

Well... I was just wondering... Do you know Tara? Like, are you friends?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Yeah, sure! We've been friends for almost two years now! Why do you ask?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well, I was just curious about how she was as a person outside her duties as vice-captain.<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Oh... *wonders* We've been through a lot together. I mean, most of the experiences have ocurred during work hours, but we've always had fun together.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Like, what?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
I will say she's always been... a little wild. When we met last year I was a little nerd, computer geek, etc... and she was my opposite. If fact, she was the one that led me to dancing! I heard that on last year's cruise she had a taste of every man the first day they boarded! Isn't that insane!?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Umm... yes, I guess...<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
... Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings... I've heard.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Heard what?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
You and Tara, you know... not just about the first night (everybody knows that...), but also... you know... I mean, she won't stop talking about you! "$name has got an amazing ass for a boy, $name is so cute..." etc, etc...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
... Really?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Yeah! And if I'm honest, I haven't seen her this hooked on a... "man", like, EVER.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Wow... Tara likes me?) So... what can I do?<</speech>>
Anastasia smiles playfully.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
If you were anybody else I would tell you to go to her room and fuck her with your big cock. But in your case, I may skip that. Maybe you can talk to her tomorrow on your weekly review? Just bring it up and see how she reacts.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>

I was wondering if you would let me see your card...<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Why? Hehehe... it's just a card!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
I don't know... just curiosity?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
 *shrugs her shoulders* Sure, whatever.<</speech>>
She digs deep into her bra, rubbing her right breast.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Ooops, not here...<</speech>>
She searches the other breast and finally whips her card out.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh, yeah, I see...<</speech>>
You can barely differenciate one from the other. Both cards have the same color, the same shape, and the same texture... An idea crosses your mind.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(I could try to exchange cards, although she would figure it out as soon as she tried to open her bedroom door... I have to think of something else...) So how do these cards really work? They look the same...<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Well, nothing too complicated. The card keys store the data in a magnetic layer placed inside the plastic. So it's not about the card itself, but about the magnetic stripe and the data inside.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
That sounds interesting... would you mind showing me?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Not at all! Let me grab my computer!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(She doesn't seem to be suspecting a thing...)<</speech>>
Anastasia walks to the corner of the tent and grabs her laptop and a card reader from her backpack. Then she sits down on the floor and tells you to do so.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
See, this is the data in my card.<</speech>>
You lean into the screen but you don't understand a thing. You can read some stuff, but it all seems disjointed and confusing.

<div class="center"><img src="classes/dance/hacker.gif" width="50%"></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Wow... it is amazing. You can understand all this?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Well, yes! ... Do you want to see something crazier??<</speech>>
Her tone sounds like a kid's playing a game.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Um... sure!<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
 *she whisper into your ear* I can hack them...<</speech>>
Your eyes widen as she says that. This could be your oportunity. You know that she won't do it, or if she does, she will tell Captain T, and that would be a catastrophe.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(I need to play it cool) Hey... how about we HACK a card?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
 *she puts a childish long face* Captain said I couldn't... it's against the rules...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Hey, you know what? I won't tell if you don't tell.<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Hm... ok! Let's try with a blank one! *smile*<</speech>>
She gets out another card from her backpack, this one is a little smaller, but it looks fairly similar. Anastasia puts the card in the reader and starts clicking. She really seems to be concentrating.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
I just need to... copy my code to the blank one... and then... just...crack it! See?! ''Level 2 access!''<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Full... access...)<</speech>>
Your eyes sparkle.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
But unfortunately I haven't been able to unlock the ''Level 1 access''. It's really hard... I would have to concentrate for AN HOUR.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Wonder what this girl could do if she concentrated on her programming abilities...)<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Aaaanyway... I should turn this off before anyone sees me. I could get in trouble...<</speech>>
Then she closes the laptop and starts putting it in the cover.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(This is my chance!)<</speech>>
As quick as you can, you make the change. Luckily, Anastasia doesn't notice.<<set $roomkey to false>>

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
You've never been there?<</speech>>

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
I'm going to need you to give me your phone and come sit with me on the table. Can I?<</speech>>
She extends her hand, waiting for you to give her your phone. You reach for it in your pocket.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Here... *you hand her the phone*<</speech>>
You both sit in a chair and you watch how she connects the phone to the computer and starts doing some stuff you can't really figure out. The only thing you are able to understand is a popup window with a filling bar and an "Installing" title.

Anastasia, I appreciate your gift, but this is really not my thing. Plus, we're on a boat! How is this even going to work?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
I configured the range to the next docking we're doing, so you can hook up if you finally find someone you like! Don't be like that! I was just as shy as you, but when you realise how good people really are, you will love it! You need someone to talk, a friend...<</speech>>

(I mean... I am feeling alone and rejected, so this could help...) What if nobody likes me?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Aww... how is someone not going to like you? You are cute and very nice.<</speech>>
You look at Anastasia with a sincere smile.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Oh, and also: this is a Captain T task, and she is aware of the use you give the app, so at least open it and see what's going on. Otherwise... she will get mad...<</speech>>
You feel encouraged by her kind words.

(How can I ask her about "M" without exposing myself?...)

Well, every time I go to Stoya's office I go through a lab, and I was wondering what exactly are they doing there. Is Stoya the boss?<</speech>>
You are surprised by how smooth that came out, but you're definitely being nosy.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
So you're interested in science or what? *smiles*<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Not specially, but it's kind of weird having a lab in a ship, isn't it?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Well, in case you haven't noticed yet, this is not a normal ship... Hahaha<</speech>>
You can't help but chuckle along with her. You couldn't agree more.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Stoya is an employee, just as me! She is just following orders. I don't really know that much about what the lab is really for...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
C'mon, Anastasia... *talking in a playfull way* I know you know more about this ship than anyone here... You're so smart!<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
 *blushes and giggles* Well thank you... I know don't know that much about the investigation itself, because it's relatively new, and since last year I haven't been involved in it... I don't really remember that much...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(She knows something, but she's either not remembering or she doesn't want to tell me)

And what about Stoya's boss? Who is really managing the lab?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
I shouldn't be talking to you about this... this is wrong...<</speech>>

It's ok if you don't tell me, I just want to know (I have to make her feel safe)<</speech>>

Ok... Well the lab's head is a woman: "Doctor M", she is on the ship incognito and she's... w- working on-<</speech>>
Suddenly Anastasia stops talking and opens her eyes wider.

You wave your hands in front of her but she doesn't react.

Hehe... well, I don't remember everything I've done, but it is true that I've changed a lot in only one year. Before I came here I was a shy and introvert girl. But there's something about the people here that just makes me want to open myself, you know?<</speech>>

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Oh! You mean the responsive 3D model! Yes! It's actually a very interesting prototype. It was designed by a swedish woman as part of an investigation about women's sex toys. Did you... *giggle* "interact" with it?<</speech>>

What? No, I didn't...<</speech>>

Meanwhile, Anastasia goes on talking about the sculpture's fabrication process.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
-and after 3D printing every part, they got all the parts together and polished the rough edges. Also, the penis is a special piece of its own! Since size preference is variable, it's supposed to be able to adapt to the each girl, but this prototype didn't need that feature, since... well... it's filled with size queens! Hahaha<</speech>>
A smile runs through your face at Anastasia's joke.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
And what about the liquid?<</speech>>
Suddenly, Anastasia's laugh stops.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
That-that's a very good question. Actually, the model has a container inside which can be filled with cum substitutes. So when you tease the model's sensor enough, it will "cum", so to say.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(She hasn't answered my question... better play it cool.) Oh, so the sculpture reacts to stimuli? That is very advanced, isn't it?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
OMG! Of course! It's just like a real lover: he needs some lOoOoOoOove *mimics a blowjob*<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
So... the sculpture only "cums" when pleasured? And is it real cum, or what is it that it's in this one?<</speech>>

Oh! Yeah, but I'm afraid not. I'm sorry, we would all like that, but cum needs to be fresh to be tasty. Definitely better if it comes directly from the source. *licks lips*<</speech>>

And what is the substitute substance you put in there? (She's not going to give me an answer, I need to add some flavour to the question...) Will it hurt my stomach...?<</speech>>

Oh, poor thing... don't you worry about that. It's only... strawberry flavoured... milk? Yes, milk.<</speech>>

So, what are your favourite ways to relax?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Oh, well... I like chilling like this... although I can't remember the last time I needed to "relax", really. I feel comfortable with you, though... *smiles*<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
 *smile back* (She's so nice I feel bad for doing this...)<</speech>>
You get closer to her ear and whisper:

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Callum Fritz...<</speech>>
Anastasia's eyes close this time, instead of opening wide, which makes you think that it's finally working as it should.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Poor girl... I bet Jada broke her like this.) Um... repeat with me: My name is Anastasia.<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
My name is Anastasia.<</speech>>
You are a bit scared by the nonchalant tone of her voice, but you're not going to waste this chance.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Ask my question: who is "M"?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
... ... "M"... is ... the head doctor of the experiment on this ship.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Nice, it's working!) What is the experiment about?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
... ... Uncertain... ... "M" is conducting an experiment on this ship, using all the passengers as a control group, and only some of them as subjects. I was one of her subjects... ...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Finally some information...) Where is "M"?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
... ... Uncertain... ... She is at the lab, or... playing...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(She won't say any more about that... maybe the golf? the casino?)<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
V... I... P...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Oh, ok! At the VIP area of the casino! How will I get in there, though...) What exactly are the experiments about?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Classified... ...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(What? Even her removed memories are "classified"? Maybe something more concrete...) What does the 32Zp do?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Uncertain... ... Find... the... desires... CLASSIFIED!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Oh, no, she's getting nervous. Maybe some easy question could calm her.) Do you like $name?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
I... feel sorry for him.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Why do you feel sorry for him?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
He reminds me of myself... I was different, and they changed me. They are going to do the same thing to him...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Why don't you help him?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
It's the first time we can test it with a man with his characteristics... 32Zp will find his desires...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Find my desires...?) What do you mean by that?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
CLASSIFIED!! *shakes*<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
What's your taste in men? (Let's hope that distracts her...)<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
... ... I like big white men, with hair in the chest and rough. Just like my...my...my...fatherrr... DADDY?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Oh, no, this is getting out of hand... better ask something else.) Do you think I could resist it?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
No. There's nothing to resist. You ARE like that.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Hm... what does she mean...? Maybe I should just ask for a specific thing) Hand me a vial so I can stay awake during Stoya's Health Review.<</speech>>
Anastasia suddenly stands up and walks toward her bag. She brings out a blue vial and gives it to you before returning to the mat.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
What does the blue vial do?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Makes you stay awake without inmediate side-effects.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Nice! Now I will be able to stay awake during the procedure!)<</speech>>
''Blue Vial'' added to Inventory.<<set $bluevial to true>>

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Alright, that's enough...) Anastasia, at the count of 3 you're going to wake up. 1... 2... 3!<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Hey! Stop shouting... 3 what? You crazyyyy hahaha Anyway, is there anything at all you would like to ask?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Hm... no, I think I'm good. Oh my god! Look at the time! I need to get going!<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
What? Oh, true... Wow, times really flies! Bye! *throws a kiss*<</speech>>

Anastasia does some weird faces and stand up.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Agghh...<</speech>>
It looks like those words really hurt her brain. But this time she seems to have entered more easily on that "hypnosis" state. Now's the moment to ask away.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(I can't risk it asking for hard stuff or she'll wake up, but before I forget...) Hand me a blue vial.<</speech>>

\\<<elseif $answers is 14>><<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(I feel awfull doing this to one of the scarce nice people on this fucking ship... but...)<</speech>>
You take a step forward, coming closer to her. You can see she didn't manage to dry all of the sweat off, but it does not smell bad at all. If anything, it reminds you of the scent of Captain's pussy, which only makes you more excited about this.

You finally stretch your arms and grope her boobs.

<div class="center"><img src="classes/dance/grope.gif" width="60%"></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oooh... (they're so slippery and nice...)<</speech>>
You start pinching and twisting her hard nipples before digging right into them and sucking on them. You take a look at her face, just to make sure she's still hypnotized, and although she is, you can't help but feel bad about it.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Poor girl... she's probably gone through the same as me...)<</speech>>
After a few seconds you feel very stupid doing this, since you can feel your dick is not even getting semi-hard, and so you step back and dry her nipples with your fingers.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
 *sigh* (You're so hot Anastasia... but my "thingy" is not even responding now...)<</speech>>
Frustrated and feeling bad about yourself, you decide to get into the questioning.

[[Try to dig in deeper inside her mind|Answers][$answers to 15]]



\\<<elseif $answers is 15>><<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(I'd probably need to get deeper to get past that "classified" barrier they've put on her head! But... how?)<</speech>>
You stare at a dead-faced Anastasia. You feel sorry for her, and you know that she is probably suffering with all these sessions, but this is the only way you're being able to know more about this ship! You need to do this. If you do it correctly, you might eventually liberate her mind and let her be whoever she used to be before the brainwash.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Anastasia... you can trust me.<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
I- can- trust- you.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
I mean, the real you. The Anastasia before the ship, if you can hear me, let me know how can I set you free.<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
... ... ...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Well, it wasn't going to be that easy...) Give me a casino VIP invitation, please.<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Only the Captain can assign those.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Maybe she can upgrade my card!) Make my access card level 1.<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Level 1 is only available for some of the staff members.<</speech>>
You sigh, unable to understand what you are supposed to do next. This seems like a dead end until you find out... Suddenly, you have an idea.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Ok, this probably won't work, but it's worth a try...) Can I know all about the ship's company records about hypnosis?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
... ... *blinks fast* Yes, you can. The records of the SQ Cruise Ship are accessible to the higher members of the company.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Can that be hacked?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Yes.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Hack it right now and retrieve any files that have to do with "hypnosis".<</speech>>
Anastasia walks away to her laptop and starts digging in there, passing through random programs and tabs. 

<div class="center"><img src="classes/dance/hacker2.gif" width="60%"></div>
You can't seem to understand anything she's doing, but it could work. After a few procedures, you finally get to a page you can recognize: it's a blank screen with a simple password slot.

<div class="center"><img src="classes/dance/hacker3.jpg" width="50%"></div>
Anastasia tries one same password 2 times, but both of them fail.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Password is not correct.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(They must've changed it after last year, so she doesn't know it) Which password were you trying?<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
''BNWO-z32''<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Do you have any idea of what could be the new one? They must have changed it after you left-<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
I- left- I--- I didn't leave, they put me away...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Oh, no... she needs to relax a bit) Yes, I know, but now we're here and you're fine, remember? Everything's fine.<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
They... ''Callum Fritz''...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Oh fuck! She said it herself...)<</speech>>
...

...

...

You wait 30 seconds for her to either keep talking or completely wake up. You are about to speak, when you notice her fingers moving while hovering over the keyboard. She seems to be typing something on the air.

You gently take her hands closer to the keyboard. She suddenly stops, and starts typing again.

<<linkreplace "Types password">><<addmins 50>><<if ndef $mutefx>><<audio "ding" play>><<else>><</if>><div class="center"><font size="+2">''YOU'RE IN!''</font></div>
<div class="center"><img src="classes/dance/hacker4.gif" width="50%"></div>
You can see Anastasia scroll down lots of names and information.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Search for "hypnosis", please.<</speech>>
You are starting to think that maybe, just MAYBE, you will be able to communicate with the Anastasia trapped inside her mind. After some typing and scrolling, one result pops out: "Anastasia Fritz".

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(''MIT, Stanford, Doctor...'' damn, she really is a big deal! But I don't need a CV...) Are there confidential records about the same subject?<</speech>>
Anastasia types something quickly, showing some red text below.

<div class="center"><span class="red">Vice-president. Relegated by choice.</span></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(WTF, relegated by choice? That doesn't even make any sense!)<</speech>>
You keep reading:

<div class="center"><span class="red">Female subject_0 (voluntary). Quick mental shift. Treatment paused due to arise of dissociative disorder, related to therapy sessions. Subject often presented an unusual openness, only disturbed by some trigger expressions. These expressions can make the subject dissociate on different levels.

<font size="+1">Triggers:</font>
- ''Callum Fritz'' (superficial, will switch back easily)
- ''Black New World Order'' (deeper, will stay for a couple hours)
- ''_CLASSIFIED_'' (top secret, will stay for days)</span></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(At least I got something out of that: ''Black New World Order'' seems to be another expression to trigger her into a deeper dissociative state...)<</speech>>
You're about to try it out, but just as you're about to do it, you see her winking very fast. You know that if you don't hurry up she'll come back to being the Anastasia you know and see what you've made her do.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh! Close the laptop and erase all evidence, Anastasia.<</speech>>
She does so, but you can tell it's taking longer for her to do it. Finally she closes it and puts it in its original place. Five seconds later, she wakes up:

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Huh? Um... what has happened? Did something- oh, well, nevermind... let's get started with the class. OMG, look at the time! We barely have enough time to get started on the basics! Come on, follow me!<</speech>>
She grabs your arm and gets you some space around, so you can fit on the mats.

[[Start first dance class|Answers][$answers to 16]]<</linkreplace>>



\\<<elseif $answers is 16>><<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Alright, then. First of all, you need to understand that your body needs to be relaxed, serving as a blank canvass for you to express yourself through movement.<</speech>>
You stare at her a bit confused while she gets her phone and puts on some dance music.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
C'mon, just mooove.<</speech>>
You stare at her, not knowing what to do. Anastasia stops the music.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
I'm sorry, I just don't know what to do...<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
That's okay, maybe I haven't explained myself good enough. *smiles* I'll put some music, and you just have to move your body to the rhythm. Just let yourself go, like a leaf on the wind. FREESTYLE!<</speech>>
She puts the music back on, and starts dancing herself.

<div class="center"><img src="classes/dance/dance1.gif" width="60%"></div>
You're impressed. Her freestyle moves are probably better than yours if you had a whole week to practice a choreography. Encouraged by her dancing, you start moving your feet, jumping around to the rhythm of the music.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Good, good! That's it! Just let it go... close your eyes!<</speech>>
You do as she tells you and just enjoy the dance for a while.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Hahaha... (This is not bad at all!)<</speech>>
It has been a while since you laughed sincerely. But it seems like Anastasia has a gift for bringing it out for you. Suddenly, she takes your stiff hips and tries to move them around, incorporating that to your "dance".

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Just a bit of circle movement. Don't be so...  *pushes you* stiff!<</speech>>
Anastasia stops dancing herself to take a better look at you.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
Wow! Look at you!<</speech>>
<div class="center"><img src="classes/dance/dance2.gif" width="65%"></div>
As soon as you do so, your focus vanishes and start to stiffen your hips again. Anastasia stops the music.

<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia:''">>
That was actually good for a moment there! You just need to be able to accept those movements into your repertoire, and not feel ashamed of them. It's too bad that we've got to stop now, but we'll continue with it very soon. Who knows? You might even learn enough to help me on my shows!<</speech>>
