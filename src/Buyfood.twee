Hi, would you like to spend your points on a treat?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well, maybe not right now. I actually wanted to ask you about some "protein shakes"?<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender:''">>
Oh, I see... haha... yeah, "protein shakes", the ones you shakeshakeshake and the protein squirts right all over you, huh?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
What? No! I don't mean... sperm...<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender:''">>
Oooh, talking about tasty stuff, I have new awesome drinks that I bet you would like... too bad I can only serve them at the lounge...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(This woman can't even mantain a normal conversation...) Okay... *sigh* But what about the actual Protein Shakes that I'm asking for?<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender:''">>
Well, you're not the only one on this ship asking for "outside stuff", so let's say that I may be able to help you, but...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(There's always a "but"...) But what?<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender:''">>
Let's just say that you'll owe me one, okay? I need some brave girl that will try my newest stuff. Would you be up for it?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Do I have another option?<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender:''">>
Heh... not really. I'll let you know when I need you, my little guinea pig... Meanwhile, here are your protein shakes.<</speech>>
