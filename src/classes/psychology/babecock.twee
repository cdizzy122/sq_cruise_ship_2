Ok, got it? Now it's time for the second phase, ready?<</speech>>

That was kind of a disaster... you only managed to recognize <<print $correct>> out of 15 images. You should learn to be more observant, $name. I will talk to Holli about this, you will need some suplements in your nutrition plan. For now I'm just going to let you go.

Ah! Ms.Foster and me have put together a neat compilation of books and magazines in the ''Library''. Reading some of the articles could help you with your... personal growth.<</speech>>

That wasn't too bad, was it? How did you feel?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Um... I'm not sure about some of them, but I think some might be okay...<</speech>>
<<speech "psycho" "''Jada:''">>
Well, you got <<print $correct>> out of 15, so although it is not perfect, you did good enough. If you develop a perfect awareness you will be able to understand women better, even feel what they feel. I will let Holli know about this, she may want you to take some of her suplements.

Wow, you are very good at this! You even got a perfect score! 15 out of 15. I didn't expect you to get them all, but I guess that the cards being about pretty girls really got you motivated, huh? *smiles*<</speech>>
Jada looks at you with a grin on her face and makes you feel uncomfortable.
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Um... no, it's just that I concentrate and...<</speech>>
<<speech "psycho" "''Jada:''">>
Oh, I see... so it's not the girls, huh? *writes on notebook* I'm glad to tell you that your treatments are going well for now, keep up the good work, $name! I will let Holli know about this, she may want you to take some of her suplements. Although your awareness is already good enough, it wouldn't hurt.
