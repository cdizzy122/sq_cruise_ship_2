<<speech "nobody" "''Lady:''">>
Hi sweetie, coming for the welcome act? May I have your room card for a second.<</speech>>
 *You hand her your card*
 
<<speech "nobody" "''Lady:''">>
Allright, all set. Here you go. *she gives your card back* You are the first one to come yet. The seats are not numbered, so sit wherever you feel like. Have fun!<</speech>>
Without knowing what to expect, you enter the <<linkappend "door to the stage." t8n>>

<img src="places2/stage.png" width="70%">

The luxury and awesomeness of the theater catches you completely by surprise. You certainly weren't expecting something as big as this inside a ship. As you are the first one to arrive, you choose to sit in the front row so you get the best view.

Little by little the crowd fills the theater. Each woman that comes in seems hotter and sexier than the last one. They all come in pair or in groups of three or more. All this is making you feel regretful about sitting in the front row. Every girl that comes in has a full view of you, and every giggle you hear them make, makes you blush even redder. You feel embarrased just for being there. You try to keep your cool and just look ahead to not call unnecesary attention upon yourself.

Time passes and people cease to come in. you take a look back and see that nearly all the seats are occupied, but nobody has sat in the first row. Not even at the second row. You are all alone.

The remaining lights suddenly turn off, that being the starting mark for the show.

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Ok, ladies, I won't retain you much more from the party at the pub on the back of the theater, but I have one surprise more for you...you've all got A FREE ROUND OF DRINKS FOR EACH ONE!<</speech>>
<span class="shudder"><span class="onomatopeya">*CROWD CHEERS*</span></span>
 
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
So, without further ado...- her eyes heavily stop right into yours.
Well, girls, looks like we have an unexpected passenger. IT'S A BOY!<</speech>>

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Now, now... treat him properly, ladies. I know there weren't supposed to be men until further on in the trip, but oh well... Make him feel like he is at home, and worship him like the man we hope he is.<</speech>>

<<speech "nobody" "''Lady:''">>
Hi sweetie, we were just waiting for you! Can I have your card?<</speech>>
Your eyes open wide. Just when you are about to make up any excuse for leaving it at the room or something, she interrupts your thoughts.
 
<<speech "nobody" "''Lady:''">>
Oh, she's going to get into the stage now, just go in. C'mon, c'mon!<</speech>>
The woman takes you by the hand and leads you to one of the last seats left.

<div class="center"><img src="cap/capcute.jpg" width="50%"></div>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Well, hi there, lovelies! I know that we've been having so much fun these week, all by ourselves, but you better brace yourselves, because men are coming in TODAY!<</speech>>
<span class="shudder"><span class="onomatopeya">*CROWD CHEERS*</span></span>

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Now, I'm not going to waste your time explaining all the rules, because I'll have to repeat them once men come in, so I'll save it for later! Instead, I'll just tell you that we are going to get to the upper deck and give them an awesome welcome, okay? And please, don't go running down the stairs to meet them before I say so. We want to give them enough time to get in, unpack their stuff and then I'll talk to you through the intercom to convene all of you here to explain the rules.<</speech>>

<span class="shudder"><span class="onomatopeya">*CROWD COMPLAINS*</span></span>

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
I know, girls, I know... but the rules are only going to be there for your enjoyment, have I ever lied to you? And also, believe me, be patient, just for today. You'll have enough dick the rest of the trip!<</speech>>
<span class="shudder"><span class="onomatopeya">*CROWD CHEERS AGAIN*</span></span>

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(She seems nice when she wants to...)<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
So, now, follow the attendants on the sides, they'll lead you to the upper deck.<</speech>>
Just as the Captain finishes talking, the women stand up, eagerly wanting to go to the upper deck.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Jesus, can't they behave like good girls, <span class="pink">just like me?</span>)<</speech>>
Your side slowly gets out the stage and, although the line is not very organized, you know the way to the upper deck, so it's just a matter of time, you're not getting lost. On the way to the deck you keep looking around, searching for familiar faces with which share the experience, but all you see is unknown horny and eager bitches, with the ocasional milf that laughs at you and tries to humiliate you by lifting their pinkies or pinching your ass cheeks.

<div class="center"><img src="dockings/casablanca/group.jpg" width="50%"></div>
After a few minutes you arrive to the upper deck, which you never though could be so full. This overcrowding seems to be slowing down the whole process, so you can hear Captain T talking through the speakers:

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Please, stack yourselves to the side of the ship so you can have a look to the ground. If you can't see, just go to the 8th deck so you can.<</speech>>
The first thing you want to do is go back and go down to the 8th deck, but even before you can, a wave of women run down, leaving you no choice but to stay up.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Hey, $name! Right here, come and take a look!<</speech>>
You can see Tara calling you from the same deck you're in. You smile at her and walk her way. You crawl through the annoyed crowd until you reach where she is, right at the best spot.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh, thank you Tara...<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
No prob... *smiles and pats your ass*<</speech>>
You look down and inmediately are amazed by how high the 9th deck actually is.

<div class="center"><img src="dockings/casablanca/casablanca.jpg" width="70%"></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
It's so high...<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
I know, but you can really get a good view from here, and also, they can.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Who?<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Them... *points to a side*<</speech>>
As you turn your head to the side, you see a line of men walking towards the central door of the ship. Some women have already started to cheer and shout. As they get closer, you understand why that place is perfect for the ocasion. You can get a good idea of how the people getting into the ship look.

<div class="center"><img src="dockings/casablanca/line.jpg" width="50%"></div>
Captain T gets out the main door and greets them, making signs so they start showing the tickets and going in. Just as they do, all the girls around you, except Tara, start shouting very dirty compliments.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Do you notice how most of them are black or mixed? That's not only because of where we have docked, but all the men you see are also around the 60% of the total that will come in. We'll be picking up more as we go down the coast of Africa and once we cross the Atlantic ocean. You will see some white guys... but the ratio of black men will always be higher...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Hm...<</speech>>
You could ask why that is, but you feel like you know the answer.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Now, see that white guy? I'm sure he has a huge dick. Probably bigger than the black guys next to him.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
How do you know that?<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
He's taller, big hands, am overall relaxed, but Alpha vibe... He's got a big one for sure!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh... <span class="pink">(Wow... so wise...)</span><</speech>>
After 10 minutes of men passing by, your attention is already worn out, but suddenly, Tara re-directs your face so you look at the line again.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
There he is!!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Who? What do you mean?<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
See that black guy?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Um... are you for real? You just told me they are all black!<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Oh, he's sitten on his suitcase...<</speech>>
You are just about to look at Tara and tell her that she's acting a bit crazy, but just a second after she said that, the tallest beast you've ever seen in your life stands up and walks towards Captain T.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
OMG! That guy is literally twice as tall as Captain T!!<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
I know... that guys comes every year, he's a regular customer. A very mysterious guy, but certainly the biggest I've ever seen, or felt... *bites lips*<</speech>>
You try to take a closer look at him and notice how his hands completely cover the Captain's as they pass the ticket over. He even has to crouch so he can get through the door of the ship.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
I'm telling you, $name... you better hope he doesn't like you...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Oh, god...<</speech>>
Your face turns pale just by the thought of it. You are not even able to manage what every woman on this ship already can, that monster would definitely rip you in half, probably not even needing his dick for that... But you can't help but imagine how would his "thing" look...

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
<span class="pink">(If an average black man has 8/9 thick inches... how would that monster compare... *bite your lips*)</span><</speech>>
While the rest of the line comes into the ship, you just can't help but keep thinking about that massive black guy and his secrets. You try to convince yourself that "you are not gay, you're just curious...".

After what seems like a very short time to you, Captain T goes back inside and talks on the intercom.

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Okay, ladies and... gentlemen! We are finally together! But this is not only going to be about pleasure, there are some rules you must follow. To get familiar with them, I'll meet you all at the stage. Men are already there, so please, ladies, make me proud and try not to cause much of a conmotion while you go down... to the stage.<</speech>>
As Captain T hangs up, most women hurry down the stairs, but some of them try to walk like they normally would. You are even happy that most of them go first, so they get out of the way as soon as possible.

Once you get to the 4th deck and are about to get into the stage, you take a big breath and gather courage to do this.

<<linkreplace "Into the stage">>As soon as you get in, you notice that all the seats are taken by women, no men... but suddenly, you can hear some unusually low voices cat-calling from above. Seems like there was a higher circle of seats around the stage.

<<speech "nobody" "''Mixed man:''">>
Hey, you! That busty brunette! Yeah, you! I'm gonna grab those titties and cum all over that face of yours! Hahahaha<</speech>>
About 5 different, but similar women stand up and shake their titties.

<div class="center"><img src="dockings/casablanca/brunette.gif" width="50%"></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(God... some bitches are sooo dumb...)<</speech>>
Captain T comes out to the stage and grabs the mic.

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Well, hello there, studs!<</speech>>
<span class="shudder"><span class="onomatopeya">*FEMALE CROWD CHEERS*</span></span>

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Hahaha... well, so are we. But we've got to set the rules up first! I've prepared an awesome presentation for the ocasion, so please... LIGHTS OFF!<</speech>>

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Now, I know we're all eager to have some fun, but we have some rules for you: ''First of all'', I understand you boys are all tough and are used to taking what you want. That's fine, as long as the girl (or girls) are okay with it. There's a very thin line separating rough sex from rape, and we all like to explore it. But make sure that she's into it or I'll be obligated to make you get out of the ship. ''Non-consensual rape is NOT allowed.''<</speech>>

(What? Are they booing? Are these women mad? Why would they want to get raped?)<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Silence, girls. I know some of you want to be dominated, but being non-consensually raped is not the same. The rules are there for a reason. ''Second rule:'' Continuing with the limitations for men-<</speech>>

<div class="center"><img src="stage/stagecasa2.png" width="30%"></div>
<span class="onomatopeya">*MALE CROWD BOO*</span>

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Shhh! More limitations for men: we will have a certain schedule for "women only" for some of the public spaces, like the swimming pools, the gym and the library. This is meant to give us girls the possibility to have our own time whenever we want. Of course, this will only be for a few hours a day. The rest of time, it'll be mixed.

For you, men, you have a "penny arcade" available on the 5th deck. That's a "men only" place, and it's also rules free. So if you women are thinking about going in there, just take into account that rules don't apply, including the rape one...<</speech>>
<span class="onomatopeya">*MALE CROWD CHEERS*</span>

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Well, at least I can get through some places without having to encounter any men...)<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
''One last thing:'' We have added a new feature to this year's ship. Men have been ranked from ''C to S+'' by our company experts. We've taken a lot of factors into account, like height, penis size, sexual prowess and wealth, among others. You will be able to know this rating on their mandatory badge:<</speech>>

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
I know! Exciting, isn't it? I should state that every man on this ship lives up to our standards, so they're all good. But, since this could seem a one-sided decision, we've decided to also add a ''ranking for us women!!''<</speech>>

<span class="onomatopeya">CLICK</span>

<div class="center"><img src="screenwall/0.jpg" width="57%"></div>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
As you can see, we won't have to wear badges, since we have not been rated yet. It is YOU guys who will vote us. The girls with the most number of votes will be displayed on top of the list, kind of like a "popularity" contest. So now you know: Girls, be nice to your men... *wink* You will be able to see this list on both deck 5 and 6.

So, in short:<</speech>>
<span class="onomatopeya">CLICK</span>

<div class="center"><font size="+2"><span class="red">''1. NO NON-CONSENSUAL RAPE'' (except in men only area, "penny arcade")</span>

<span class="blue">''3. MEN WEAR THEIR RANKING ON A BADGE. WOMEN CAN BE GIVEN VOTES, WHICH WILL BE DISPLAYED ON A SCREEN''</span></font></div>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Now that we're clear on the rules, men will follow me out the stage so me and my staff can show them around their decks. Women will wait until we're out and Tara will lead them back to their rooms. We are in Casablanca, so you'll be able to get out to explore the city in around an hour.<</speech>>
Captain T leaves the mic and takes the men out of the stage to their decks. Once your group is alone, Tara stands and lead you all to your decks, going down to the third one and then to the second.

Before you can even relax, someone knocks at your door. You go and open it.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Hey, I'm finally done with the girls. I have a nice surprise for you: I'll be going with you into Casablanca, since I also need to do some important errands. And if everything goes as planned, you'll get an awesome present at the end, you'll see...<</speech>>
You blush, thinking what could that "present" be about.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Ok... should we go now then?<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Sure, it's nice that you're not dressed as too much of a slut. Casablanca is not the place for that. You know, they say it's a "multicultural city", but they are pretty conservative when it comes to those things. Although, I must say, you're getting cuter by the day, $name...<</speech>>
She leans in and gives you a kiss. Then she holds your hand, dragging you out of your room and taking you to the reception and out the ship.

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
The show's about to start, what do you mean you're not happy with outcome of the play?<</speech>>
<<speech "Ashley" "''???:''">>
It's just that... you know, I've written it, so I would just like it to be as I pictured it. That's all!<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
I understand, but you've got to understand that there are no masculine actors on the ship, so it's only logical that a woman would play "the hubby".<</speech>>
<<speech "Ashley" "''???:''">>
Yeah, I know, I get it...<</speech>>
You wait a few seconds for them to go away, but they don't seem like they would be down to stop talking for a while, so you just decide to walk past them and into the stage area.

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
I think it's very well done, my favourite part would be- Oh, hi there, little boy! Are you coming to watch the play? I know you love watching for sure...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Yeah, um... no more class for the rest of the day, so I thought I would come...<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Nice, I think you'll find it... instructive.<</speech>>
Just as you are about to walk past them, the unknown woman whispers something into Captain's ear.

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Oh, yeah, not a bad idea! Hey, $name, how would you like to become a superstar?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
What do you mean?<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Ashley here is the original writer of the story you are about to see today. There's a... ''small'' role in the play that we think you could do just fine.<</speech>>
Instantly embarrased by the idea, you take a good look at Ashley's face:

<div class="center"><img src="passengers/ashley1.jpg" width="50%"></div>
She's so beautiful that you almost say "yes" without giving it a thought. You should decide. You can either relax and enjoy the show, or please Ashley and try to become an actor for an hour.

...

...

The extravagant woman keeps standing near the backstage entrance door, angry, but you can also notice some worry on her face. You don't know if it is a good time to talk to her, so you just stand in place. Just when you're about to get going, Ewa speaks:

<<speech "ewa" "''Ewa, the great'':">>
What are you looking at? *stares directly at you*<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Oh, um... nothing, I was just...<</speech>>
<<speech "ewa" "''Ewa, the great'':">>
I know you've seen everything. It's fine... *sigh* just another assistant that runs away... they say my act is too humiliating.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
That's a shame... and what's the act about?<</speech>>
<<speech "ewa" "''Ewa, the great'':">>
Oh, you know... the classic: "assistant goes into a box, I push swords into the box holes, the assitant dissapears and then appears intact..." You might ask: "how, Ewa, how?" Well, darling... the answer is MAGIC!<</speech>>
You are soon cringed out by her pompous explanation.

<<speech "ewa" "''Ewa, the great'':">>
I mean, the public seems to really like the act, but I don't know why nobody wants to do it!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
The act sounds a bit dangerous, doesn't it?<</speech>>
<<speech "ewa" "''Ewa, the great'':">>
Not at all! In fact is one of the safest ones I do on my show, and is one of the most spectacular ones too! It's the ending of my show, and now... I don't have an ending... A magician can't do a show without a proper ending...<</speech>>
Even if she seems a bit delusional and eccentric, you can't help but feel sorry for her.

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
There must be a solution! Don't you have another act you could do instead of that one?<</speech>>
<<speech "ewa" "''Ewa, the great'':">>
I'm afraid not... that's my main act, the reason why people come. It's got risk, comedy, sexiness... I just need another assistant, but how? We are on a fucking ship!<</speech>>
You suddenly come up with a possible solution: you could be her assistant for the act. But you don't know if you should say it out loud. After all, her assitants surely quitted for a reason...

<<speech "ewa" "''Ewa, the great'':">>
I need someone that sticks out from the crowd, someone not too tall since she would need to fit in a box... *she takes a look at you* Hm...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(Uh-oh, don't look at me...)<</speech>>
<<speech "ewa" "''Ewa, the great'':">>
What would you say if I asked you to be my assistant? I could give you a proper reward for it, I bet you are aching for one of those... *wink, wink*<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Um... I don't know about that...<</speech>>
Ewa gets closer to you and puts one of her arms on your shoulder, holding your head from behind with her hand.

<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender'':">>
Do I really need to guide you? Okay, then. Come on, sissy! Just take it in your hand.<</speech>>

That's a tiny hand you got there. Is everything this tiny? How about that puckering sissy-pussy that I'm feeling on my thigh.<</speechpatreon>>

Without even needing any further indications, you instinctively start stroking his thick cock to the rhythm of his rocking.

<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender'':">>
Oh my god, look at that tiny dicky she's got there! It's leaking so much!<</speech>>
You couldn't be more embarrased, but the way he's holding your back as he plays with you makes you very comfortable in a weird, new way... If it wasn't enough, Zack takes your nipple inside his mouth and starts licking it.

You weren't expecting such a rush from just your nipple, it's obvious that they are a lot more sensitive than you remember them.

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>

<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender'':">>
Come on, don't make him wait. Stroke that cock, sissy!<</speech>>

<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender'':">>
That's not hard enough. Get in there, come-on-!<</speech>>
She pushes your head forward, almost touching his penis with your nose, and making your tiny balls dangle free on the air.

Before you can even realize how far this situation has gone, the bartender grabs the glass and leaves the room to store it.

<<speechpatreon "Zack" "">><span class="imgpop zack">''Zack'':</span>

He starts grabbing your ass, probing your hole. You stand up and try to step away, but he stands up as well and gently bends you over the table. With his semi-hard, cum leaking cock, he whips your soft squishy ass.

Zack is surprised by your confidence and stares at you with an interested look on his face. Then, he lets his cards fall to the other side on the table.

<<speechpatreon "Zack" "">><span class="imgpop zack">''Zack'':</span>
I've got nothing, you win...<</speechpatreon>>
He starts taking his clothes off in front of you.

<div class="center"><img src="quest15/cock3.gif" width="32%"></div>
You watch him with an open mouth, amazed by how manly and thick everything in his body is...

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(Oh, my...)<</speech>>
<span class="onomatopeya">BBBRRRRIIINGGG</span>

<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender'':">>
Alright, enough of these games. We need another of your donation! Get inside, I'll be just there on a second.<</speech>>
Zack gets closer to you, with his cock dangling inches from your face.

<<speechpatreon "Zack" "">><span class="imgpop zack">''Zack'':</span>
I'll get that ass of yours, if you know what I mean... *slaps cock on his own hand*<</speechpatreon>>
He gets into the backroom. Once you're alone, the bartender approaches you.

<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender'':">>
Now that you've had your fun, don't think I don't know what your thinking. You will NOT tell Captain T any of this, okay?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Um... sure.<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''Bartender'':">>
Don't "sure" me, alright? I'll give you 200 points right now and we have a deal. It's not a negotiation. And I expect you to try my cocktails in the future. I will definitely need a test subjec- I mean, a taster...<</speech>>
<div class="center"><span class="notplus">''POINTS +200''</span></div><<set $points to $points +200>>

She gets to the back room, presumable about to help Zack with his "donation".
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(Why is it that anywhere I go on this ship, everything seems to just keep getting weirder...? Although, that Zack guy looked... <span class="pink">interesting...</span>)<</speech>>
You take you clothes and get out the lounge and through the dark stage back into Deck 4.
