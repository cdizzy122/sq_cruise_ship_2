As you enter the dining room, a whole collection of different smells fill your nostrils. It all smells amazing! Then you go down the stairs and sit at one of the tables.

You enjoy the food as if it was your only meal in a lifetime, but you can't help but notice the way the other girls look at you. Some are laughing and some are looking at you with a dissapproving face. Just after you finish your dinner, you see Tara making you signs to follow her.

As you enter the dining room, a whole collection of different smells fill your nostrils. It all smells amazing! Then you go down the stairs and sit at one of the tables.

The are already a few girls in the room. They seem to be grabbing food from a buffet bar in the middle. You go right to the buffet and feast on the food.

It's dinner time! As you go down the stairscase an elegant hall appears in front of you. The food in the buffet looks so inviting that the femenine crowd doesn't even bother you. You grab a plate and go straight to the buffet line. Just as you are arriving, Holli stops you:

<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Hey, hey, hey! Stop right there! You can't have this stuff. I am responsible for your diet and so it's going to be. Here is your dinner:<</speech>>

(Wtf... Pink pasta? That is weird...)<</speech>>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Well hi! Do you like my new creation?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Well, it's better than half a sandwich... but why is it pink?<</speech>>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Oh, well, that's because of the beets, mostly.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Mostly...?<</speech>>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
C'mon! A chef has to have some secrets... but I promise you will LOVE IT. Here you have some pink parmesan to pour over it. Do it now that it's hot!<</speech>>
You've never hear of pink parmesan cheese, but you guess that she could have tinted it as well, so you decide not to worry that much about it.

You grab the fork and take a bite of the pasta by itself. The cheese melted within the noodles is very soft and stretchy and really makes the dish look a lot more appealing.

<<linkreplace "... ...">><<if ndef $mutefx>><<audio "eat" play>><<else>><</if>><span class="onomatopeya">*MUNCH, MUNCH*</span>

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(This doesn't taste as I expected... it's good, but there's definitely some ingredient that's making it a bit bitter...)<</speech>>
Holli is looking at you eat and holding the cheese near you, clearly pushing you to try it. The pasta is good, so you decide to give the full experience a try.

As you fill the spoon with the powdered cheese, you are suprised by its consistency. 

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(It's literally like dust, it's so thinly powdered...)<</speech>>
You take another bite. The cheese is almost flavorless. It is a bit savory, but the aged cheesiness is not there at all...

The third bite comes faster than you thought. And then the fourth. Your body is eating it faster and faster, even though you are not especially fond of the flavour. But there is something that drags you in.

Not even 5 minutes after, the plate is empty.

<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Wow! You really liked it, huh? Nice, I'll make sure to put extra cheese these days then...<</speech>>

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(That funky pasta again... is she going to feed me the same all week?)<</speech>>
You can see there's already some of that cheese in the pasta, but Holli has left a little plate of that powdered pink parm on the side.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>

But this time, you can also see another name on a table next to yours. You get closer to it and see what's on it: "''GIADA''".

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
What? They are controlling Giada's food too?<</speech>>
You sit down on your table and just wait for Holli to bring your food. And, just like a clock, she comes out from the kitchen bringing the food.

<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Here you go!<</speech>>
<div class="center"><img src="classes/cook/dinner3.jpg" width="40%"></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
W-what is this?<</speech>>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Oh, you know, just a hot-dog, with some sides, but it's very good for you, at least this one. Give it a try before I go, go ahead!<</speech>>
You take a bite out of it and inmediately see a stream of runny white and pink cheese inside it.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(This doesn't look very healthy... Hm!)<</speech>>
Your face doesn't lie, it is very tasty, but the way that cheese tastes is very familiar and you feel like it's probably the same that the one from the spaghetti.

<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Hahaha I can tell by your face you love it! Nice!<</speech>>
You take another bite from it.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Yeah, it's tasty... Hm... Is the cheese the same one than the other time?<</speech>>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Oooh, the classes are paying of! Good, very good! That's my special cheese, yes. *smiles*<</speech>>
You are about to take another bite, when you look again at the table next to you with Giada's name on it.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Hey, um... Before you go, Holli, is Giada supposed to come here too?<</speech>>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Yeah, she should be here any minute now.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
And... (I don't know if I should ask her about it...)<</speech>>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Yes?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
I was wondering... why is Giada a "student" too?<</speech>>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Why? Hehehe Are you jealous? Don't worry, you're always my petit gars. I'm just following Captain's orders.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(Captain T brought another "student" aboard...?)<</speech>>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
But she's different, obviously. I'm the only one taking care of her. You saw it, she was too rude...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Aha... (Oh, so she's not having all those classes, but how can Holli "take care" of a person just like that...)<</speech>>
Suddenly, you see Giada come into the Dining Room.

Yeah, honey, you can eat all you want...<</speech>>
<<speech "Giada" "''Giada:''">>
Thank you Holli!<</speech>>
Giada starts eating without even questioning her.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(She's behaving like a completely different person! What did Holli do to her this evening...?)<</speech>>
Holli finally gets going.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
Hey, Giada, are you ok?<</speech>>
<<speech "Giada" "''Giada:''">>
Huh? Yeah, better than ever... just very hungry!<</speech>>
You quit talking to her, something has happened this evening to make her so compliant. She wasn't like that last time you saw her...

Holli suddenly hurries to the kitchen, busy with the service.

Just when you are finishing your dish, Giada comes into the Dining Room.

Hm, Giada's not here yet? Hm... seems like you are the best one of the two, huh? *smiles* But I already knew that! Here, have a treat!<</speech>>
Holli brings out a banana and covers it in some sort of pink cream. You look at it suspiciously.

<div class="center"><img src="classes/cook/banana1.jpg" width="35%"></div>
<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
You recognize this? From the taste-testings? Here, just for you!<</speech>>
Holli handles it to you. You take it and stare at it while Holli runs back to the kitchen.

<<speech "You" "''$name:''">>
(It's dripping... I don't want it to fall...)<</speech>>
You finally take it into your mouth and suck the cream out of it.

<<speech "Giada" "''Giada:''">>

(Damn, we're double the people now...)<</speech>>
You can't see Giada or Penny anywhere to be seen, but you decide to go straight to your usual table. As soon as you're heading there, you notice that it is occupied by some men. You look around and check for an empty table, but you can't seem to find one. After wandering around for a few seconds, you hear a voice.

<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Hey, over here!<</speech>>
<div class="center"><img src="classes/cook/holli3.jpg" width="30%"></div>
You see Holli waving her hand over the other side of the buffet. She seems very busy. You hurry and get close to where she is. Giada and Penny are sitting on random tables with other people.

<<speech "holli" "''Holli:''">>
Hi, please take a seat wherever you please. I've set up a category in the buffet from where you gurls can take your food. It's all healthy and good for your "personal growth". Just try not to be too greedy, alright?<</speech>>

Oh, well captain it would be nice for you gurls to socialize a bit. She plans on relying on you for future assignements, and you'll need some social aptitudes. Now go and have a nice dinner.<</speech>>

You take the dish and bring it back to the table.

Some of the staff is here today: Anastasia, Stoya, Foster, Jada. //(will vary everyday in 0.5.7)//

<<speech "stoya" "''Stoya'':">>
Ooooh! The perfect kind of cupcake for a cute gurl like you.<</speech>>
<<speech "foster" "''Foster'':">>
I couldn't have said it better. Very good, $name! Also, did you know dark chocolate is better for you than white? Interesting, isn't it? Although, it would be better for your diet if you didn't have any... Not to question Holli, but...<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia'':">>
Oh, c'mon, he probably did so well in the kitchen that Holli decided to give him a treat! Those look yummy, don't you think, $name?<</speech>>
You stare at the cupcakes and how the filling is coming out of the tips of the penises. Your mouth waters.

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
<span class="pink">It looks amazing...</span> Oh, because it's been a while since I've had dark chocolate.<</speech>>
Stoya quickly raises her hand.

<<speech "stoya" "''Stoya'':">>
Me too, sister... *sigh*<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia'':">>
Well, that's all on you then. Look around, we are on stock!<</speech>>
<<speech "stoya" "''Stoya'':">>
Yeah, but unlike you, some of us do work.<</speech>>
<<speech "Anastasia" "''Anastasia'':">>
Hey, I work! I'm preparing Saturday's show!<</speech>>
<<speech "foster" "''Foster'':">>
Bla, bla, bla... Less talking and more eating.<</speech>>
