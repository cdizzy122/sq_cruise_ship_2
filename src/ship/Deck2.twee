Good morning! Finally, we are in ground! Aren't you happy?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
Um... yes. Can I go out? (Am I really asking this?)<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Sure you can! In fact, I'm here on ''Holli's'' behalf. She wants you to do some errands outside.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
What exactly is that about? (Oh shit, this is not good...)<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Well, this is a ship after all. We need supplies: food, water, medicine, etc... but all of this is taken care by the company obviously, as all the quantities are overwhelming. Although there is something that Holli told me to bring:

<div class="center">''The Enhancer''</div>
Hahaha, don't worry about the name. I know it's very imposing, but it's just a... cooking ingredient.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
(Now I'm their shop boy?!) *sigh* Ok, so where is it? (Just whatever to get out of here)<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Holli told me to go to the farmer's market, in the center of La Rochelle and there find a farmer called ''Bastien''.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
Ok. So I go to the farmer's market and find Bastien. Then ask for ''The Enhancer''. Got it.<</speech>>
Just as you try to walk to the reception Tara grabs you by the arm.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Don't even think about doing any funny things. We can track you very precisely, so don't even try. I'm telling you, for your own good, don't do it.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
(How are they tracking me?? Maybe the card key, or the phone. I could throw them away, doesn't make sense. It has to be something else...)
<</speech>>
With a swift move she unzips your skinny jeans and looks at your underwear.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
<<if $under is 2>>Oooh, pink panties for a princess. You are almost too cute *she rubs your panties*<<elseif $under is 1>>Just some briefs? I have to admit I was expecting something... else...<</if>><</speech>>
Catching you by surprise, she lowers your underwear. Your face inmediately turns red. You are in the middle of the hall and anybody could see you.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
<<if $cage is true>>Oh my god! You are so obedient. Good *tap* Boy *tap* Aaah, now this is much better. See? Now you don't have to worry about getting a stiffy while walking around!<<elseif $cage is false>>There's something here that's missing, $name. And you know what it is... I guess you're still confident in your manliness, huh?<</if>><</speech>>
As soon as she puts her hands off your underwear you put them in place again, worried that somebody could see you.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Hahaha don't worry. You don't have anything we haven't seen.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
(At this point I would pay to get out)
<</speech>>
Tara leans over and gives you a sweet kiss on the cheek.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Good luck, $name *smiles*<</speech>>
As she smiles your heart warms up.

<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
(That has to be the first sincere smile in a while. Maybe she's not that bad after all...)<</speech>>

Good morning! Finally, we are on solid ground again! Aren't you happy?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
Um... yes. Can I go o-<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Sure you can! In fact, I'm here on Captain T's behalf. She wants you to do some errands.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
What exactly is that about? (Oh shit, this is not good...)<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Well, she wants you to promote our agency with these flyers. *she hands you the flyers* We're now docked near a beach, so you should go there and try to be friendly with the people around here.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
 *You look at the flyers* ...Wait. There are only 3 flyers...<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Yeah, but just read it. Every flyer is worth a favour, that way the agency can develop some customer loyalty. Smart, isn't it?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
A favour?<</speech>>
You take a look at the flyer. It says: "Come to SQ Trips, your wildest fantasies at the palm of your hand! This flyer is worth a favour. Ask me for anything. Anything."

<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
I- I...don't know about this...<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Oooh... that's cute. I'm not asking for it, baby. You're doing it.<</speech>>
Suddenly, Tara starts getting your clothes off.

<<speech "You" "''You:''">>
Wait! Why are you undressing me?!<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Well, honey. It's a NUDIST BEACH after all... See? That's it. All pretty and shaved... Go on! Get out! Now! *she leads you to the door and pushes you out*<</speech>>

Well hello my little boy... <<if ndef $tinder1>>I've heard you didn't go to Anastasia's class and didn't get the present I gave her for you. I'll break it down for you now:<<elseif $tinder1 is "Active">>I've seen that even though you went to Anastasia's class and received my present, you didn't manage to arrange a date with anyone, so I'll break it down for you:<</if>>

Since you've been all alone here, I thought you might miss some company. *smiles* So I told Anastasia to install a modified version of Tinder in your new phone. You had the chance to choose your date for today, but since you were not that interested, I took the liberty of doing that for you *wink*<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
What...? A date!? But-<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T'':">>
I know! Isn't it exciting? Hahaha... Aw c'mon... don't look at me like that! I'll help you prepare for your date, don't even worry about it. I understand a girl has to be pretty at all times.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
But... <span class="pink">who am I going to see?</span><</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T'':">>
Well, if you're that interested I'll let you take a look at the conversation:<</speech>>

\\<<else>><<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Well hello my little boy... Are you excited to visit Rome and... for your date?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(Fuck... I had almost forgotten about that...)<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
You should be getting ready for that, shouldn't you?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
I was thinking that... maybe I shouldn't go this time...<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Oh, honey, you really think you have a chance? That's so cute... but don't try me, I have lots of work to do and very little patience...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
... ...<</speech>>
Just as Captain T starts dominating you as usual, you see Tara come down from the 3rd deck.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Oh, hey! Glad I found you here, guys!<</speech>>
<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Don't call me "guy". I'm your Captain. What is the reason for this interruption?<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Oh, sorry Captain... I just thought it would be nice, before sending him to Rome, to-<</speech>>
Tara starts whispering something to Captain T's ear. You can't hear a thing.

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
Hm, not a bad idea. She might be helpful. Alright then, no time to lose. Come here, boy.<</speech>>
Captain grabs your arm and pulls from it so you follow her steps. Tara turns her neck and gives you a bright smile, which makes you smile as well, even if you're a little worried about her mysterious idea.

Captain makes you stop in front of Cherry's room.

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
There, knock.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(Oh... so we're going here.) *knock, knock*<</speech>>
Cherry opens the door and greet you.

<<speech "style" "''Cherry:''">>
Oh, hey! What's up, cutie-cute?<</speech>>
You stay in silence, as you don't have a clue of the reason why you're there. Captain T runs out of patience and pushes you inside of the room.

<<speech "cap" "''Captain T:''">>
There, "she"'s got a date today, so make her look fancy. I've got stuff to do, so I'll leave it to you, Tara. Make sure $name arrives at the port. We'll be sailing tomorrow morning, so be back before that. And you better go to that date, I have ways to know... *points at you and then gets going*<</speech>>
Tara comes into Cherry's room and closes the door.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Hm, don't worry about her. She would have already kicked you off the ship if she didn't like you, I can tell you that. But she can be a bit rough sometimes, it's part of her "charm"<</speech>>
Cherry and Tara laugh at her joke. A subtle smile appears on your face, making you feel more relaxed.

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
D-do I really have to go?<</speech>>
Both of them look at each other and "AWWWW" you. Then they smile and get close and hug you, one from each side.

<<speech "style" "''Cherry:''">>
Omg, so cuuuuteee...<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
I know... you're the cutest thing, honey... but I'm afraid Captain is right again. This is part of your training. You've got to trust us, ok?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
 *blushes* O-ok... *smiles*<</speech>>
Cherry let's you go.

<<speech "style" "''Cherry:''">>
Aaaaanyway, who is the date with? Guy, girl? CD? Maybe a gay daddy?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Um... no, not a d-daddy. (WTF?) <<if $tprofile is 1>>She's married, black and her name's Aryana. <<elseif $tprofile is 2>>She's single, white and her name's Lelu. She told me she wants to find a "good guy" for once... <<elseif $tprofile is 3>>He's single and addicted to Netflix. He just wants a... "girl" to watch series with...<</if>><</speech>>
<<speech "style" "''Cherry:''">>
Ooooh... <<if $tprofile is 1>>a black girl?? Boy, you need to step up your game for that to work... here come with me!<<elseif $tprofile is 2>>a white chick trying to find love? You might actually get lucky then... but we can do a few adjustments so you feel more like a... man? *chuckle* Come with me!<<elseif $tprofile is 3>>A man??!! Watching netflix just like that?? Hahahaha Girl, you are getting more than that, let me tell you. We need to fix you up completely, then! Come with me!<</if>><</speech>>

<<speechpatreon "penny" "">><span class="imgpop penny">''Penny'':</span>
Hi... *smiles*<</speechpatreon>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
So, where are we going today?<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Well, I'm just here to lead you both outside, since more men are coming in here and I don't want to leave you little puppies alone.<</speech>>
Tara takes your hands and walk you out the reception.

<div class="center"><img src="dockings/dakar/dakarline.jpg" width="50%"></div>
<<speechpatreon "penny" "">><span class="imgpop penny">''Penny'':</span>
Oh my god, so many people...<</speechpatreon>>
Tara then takes you as quickly as possible out to the port.

<div class="center"><img src="dockings/dakar/dakarport.jpg" width="50%"></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
But... what do we have to do here...?<</speech>>
Penny looks at you, confused. Tara gives you both a copy of the same list.

<div class="center">''Errand list'' was added to Inventory</div>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
Not here! Hahaha, we'll welcome the guys while you both get out there and explore. $name, I'll let you take care of Penny, okay? You've had a few trips out of the ship, but this is her first, so be careful.<</speech>>
<<speechpatreon "penny" "">><span class="imgpop penny">''Penny'':</span>
Errands? B-but... why do you trust us to get all this done...?<</speechpatreon>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara:''">>
 *smirk* Don't worry, the staff will be getting the important stuff. These are just errands for you gurls to have some fun. It's Stoya's recommendation that you get out and walk around. *whispers* Good luck!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Tara... Tara!<</speech>>
She quickly walks away, probably preparing to receive all these guys.

<<speechpatreon "penny" "">><span class="imgpop penny">''Penny'':</span>
... ... so, where do we go...?<</speechpatreon>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
We should get out of the port first, and then... figure it out.<</speech>>
Feeling like a leader, you let Penny follow you into the city.
