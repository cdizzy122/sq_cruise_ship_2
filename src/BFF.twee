Hi. My name is Lelu. I'm done with bad guys, they are so unreliable and misoginistic, UGH! But you seem like just the opposite of my last boyfriend, so cute! I thought we could maybe talk for awhile and take it slow. What do you say?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Umm...Hi, I'm $name.<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
I know... I already saw it in your profile...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(Oh shit, I'm so dumb) Yeah, of course you did! Haha... About what you said, I'd love to get to know you. Maybe a date?<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
Haaa, you are soo funny. So shy! But sure, I would love to. But I warn you, I want to go slow this time. I've had bad experiences in the past.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Okay then! It's a date.<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
I haven't told you my address yet, hahahaha<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Oh, right...<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
Meet me on (address)<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Noted! So I'll tell you when I can go there, is that ok?<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
Stop being so nervous! Here you go, this'll relax you. I know how you boys are.

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Oh, umm... thanks, you are really beautiful.<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
Hahahaha, I find your shyness cute. But we'll need to work on that when we meet. C'mon, I'm waiting for your pic!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
W...what?!<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
I sent you a pic, you do the same! You're new to Tinder, right? Go on, hot stuff, send it to me!<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
But I thought you said you wanted to go slow and-<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
It's just a p-i-c-t-u-r-e...! Hahaha<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Um...<</speech>>

[[Mirror selfie|BFF][$bff to 1]]
[[No can do|BFF][$bff to 2]]<<elseif $bff is 1>>You decide to take a picture on your phone in the bathroom's mirror. After a few tries you take one that doesn't make you look so bad, so you decide to send it.

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Here you go!

<div class="center"><span class="pulse"><img src="stuff/lelu2.jpg" width="50%"></span></div><</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
Well, it's something... I was honestly expecting a dick pic, but I really see you are different. You face is not there, but your belly is kinda cute though! Let me know when you are coming here. Bye-bye!<</speech>>

(What if she says that I'm not man enough...?) I'm sorry, but I have a different concept of what going slow is... We have barely spoken...<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
You know what? I have never had a reaction like that from a guy on Tinder ever... You really are one of a kind. Maybe I underestimated you and you really are a more evolved male, who can feel like me... like a woman... <</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(What is she talking about...? <span class="pink">A... woman? *smile*</span>) Well, it's not that I'm more evolved. It's just not my style, I'm sorry...<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
No, wait! This is really what I need, you know? Someone different... I'm so tired of jerks, and now that a nice guy shows I ruin it... I'm sorry...<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
No need to be sorry. (A woman apologizing to me? Well, this is new.) No need to apologize, just-<</speech>>
<<speech "lelu" "''Lelu'':">>
I know how I can make it up to you... Come pay me a visit. Don't worry, I'll be gentle and respectful ðŸ˜š<</speech>>
