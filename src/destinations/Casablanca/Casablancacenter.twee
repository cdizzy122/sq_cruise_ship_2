<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Oh my god...<</speech>>
As you step in the city, you are in awe of the beautiful buildings and the ample main street. Just walking around gives you a feeling of freedom that you'd been lacking for a month now.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
It really is beautiful, even more from the inside, isn't it?<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
... ...<</speech>>
You're too caught up in your thoughts to respond.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Are you impressed by the size or what? *pokes your belly* Hahaha<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Ow, hahaha... yeah, it's the first time I'm in a city since London. It's all been small coastal towns.<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Well, don't get lost cutie!<</speech>>
You keep following Tara, until you both arrive to an intersection and she stops.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
I need to go do an errand by myself before we get into the market. Sorry, ship business, you know... but you can check the other places until I come back, ok? Just make sure to come back to this intersection in around an hour. Bye...<</speech>>
You stand there as Tara gets into a small street and disappears.

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Fuck, I thought we were going to be together today... Oh, well, it's only an hour... I might as well visit the nearby places.<</speech>>

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Oh hey! I was almost going to start looking for you, I was worried.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Oh, haha... No need to! I was just taking a look at the mosque and the museum, and-<</speech>>
Suddenly, Tara interrupts you.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
 *gasp* Look at that HUNK! *points to your left*<</speech>>
<div class="center"><img src="dockings/casablanca/hunk.jpg" width="42%"></div>
Tara keeps pointing at him as you admire his amazing body.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Hm... look at that bulge... We could try some muslim dick together, I bet you'd like that. But we have errands to do now.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
... ... (She interrupted me for... that?)<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Oh, you look a bit mad there... Right, you were telling me all about your 20 minute tourism! Sorry, honey... I just thought you'd like the view.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
It's ok...<</speech>>
Tara leans in and gives you a kiss on the forehead. That puts a smile on your face and makes you instantly forget about it.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
So? You went to the museum, huh? I've heard cool things about it, for sure.<</speech>>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
I bet you would love it! There are all kinds of antique object, some of them are even ancient sexual toys.<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Wow, maybe we can stop by again after our errands, how about that? I bet I can make that visit more... exciting... *wink*<</speech>>
You blush as she starts walking forward into the street into the central market.

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Oh... wait!<</speech>>
