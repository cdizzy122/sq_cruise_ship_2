<<removeclass "html">><<addclass "html" "casablanca1">><<audio "casablanca" volume 0.3 loop play>>After what seems like an eternity, Zasha comes out with a large suitcase.

<<speechpatreon "zasha" "">><span class="imgpop zasha">''Zasha'':</span>
 *sigh* Is Penny still not done? Come on, we've got no time to lose...<</speechpatreon>>
You hear Penny rushing through her stuff and before 5 minutes pass, she goes out with her suitcase.

<<speechpatreon "zasha" "">><span class="imgpop zasha">''Zasha'':</span>
Finally... alright, let's go!<</speechpatreon>>
The four of you walk through the market and to the center of the city.

<div class="center"><img src="dockings/casablanca/casafuck.gif" width="50%"></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
Damn, where did all these people came from?<</speech>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Oh, wow. Looks like everyone is having fun out of the ship. Come on ladies, follow me inside. We'll be able to take out time before sailing.<</speech>>
<<linkreplace "Into the ship">><<audio "casablanca" stop>><div class="center"><img src="places2/reception.jpg" width="50%"></div>
<<speechpatreon "penny" "">><span class="imgpop penny">''Penny'':</span>
Wow! It's so classy!<</speechpatreon>>
<<speechpatreon "zasha" "">><span class="imgpop zasha">''Zasha'':</span>
Heh... we haven't been living "the life", if you know what I mean...<</speechpatreon>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Well, here you'll be part of the staff. Especially you, Zasha. You'll have to talk with the Captain, so you're clear on your duties. And you... *she points at Penny* I think you're going to love it here! You see, $name wasn't as pretty when she got on the ship.<</speech>>
Tara gives you a turn, so Penny can take a good look at you.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
He was a bit rebelious at first, but we are very nice here and managed to convince him... *wink*<</speech>>
<<speechpatreon "penny" "">><span class="imgpop penny">''Penny'':</span>
... Really?<</speechpatreon>>
<<speechpatreon "zasha" "">><span class="imgpop zasha">''Zasha'':</span>
I've had lots of issues with others, but not Penny. She's been a very good puppy from the start. So, where is my luxury suite?<</speechpatreon>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Heh, I don't know about I would call it "luxury", but it's a lot compared to your little shithole in Casablanca. I'll lead you to your rooms then.<</speech>>
You all follow Tara as she walks through the second deck. She finally stops.

<div class="center"><img src="places2/pennydoor.jpg" width="50%"></div>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Here's Penny's room. You can go in, honey. Take your things and try to relax a bit. Your training will resume tomorrow.<</speech>>
Penny takes her stuff and does so. Once she closes the door, the three of you continue walking until you reach the third deck. Tara stops again.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
And...<</speech>>
<<speechpatreon "zasha" "">><span class="imgpop zasha">''Zasha'':</span>
This'll be mine, yes.<</speechpatreon>>
She takes her stuff and grabs the keycard from Tara's hand.

<<speechpatreon "zasha" "">><span class="imgpop zasha">''Zasha'':</span>
So, I should be aware of what exactly will be my duties here.<</speechpatreon>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Um, yeah for sure. Captain will speak to you soon enough. I believe she mentioned helping at the gym.<</speech>>
<<speechpatreon "zasha" "">><span class="imgpop zasha">''Zasha'':</span>
Gym? Jesus, I hope you didn't bring me for that. Anyway, that'll be all for today, right?<</speechpatreon>>
<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Right.<</speech>>
Zasha offers one last cold smile and closes the door. You both stare at each other, a bit surprised by her passive-aggresivenes.

<<speech "tara" "''Tara'':">>
Ahem... anyway, I'll let you go now, $name. I still have some stuff to do around here.<</speech>>
You nod and smile before getting back to your room.

<div class="center"><img src="places2/bedroomship.jpg" width="50%"></div>
<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(Finally, I'm back!)<</speech>>
It doesn't take long for you to throw yourself on your soft bed and take a well deserved nap.

<<linkreplace "THUMP">><span class="onomatopeya">THUMP</span><<if ndef $mutefx>><<audio "laughbath" play>><<else>><</if>>

You can hear women laughing and talking outside, in the corridor.

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(Would they shut up...)<</speech>>
You can usually hear women coming a bit tipsy to their rooms, but tonight really seems to be quite special. You put your ear next to the wall:

<<speech "nobody" "''Low manly voice'':">>
 *kiss, kiss* Damn girl, you gonna rip these pants off.<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''High-pitched girl voice'':">>
 *groan* I'm very thirsty...<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''Low manly voice'':">>
I got you covered, girl. Want some milk? Gotta work for it though.<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''High-pitched girl voice'':">>
OMG! Your cock is too big!<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''Low manly voice'':">>
Now's too late for regrets, little girl...<</speech>>
<<speech "nobody" "''High-pitched girl voice'':">>
 *squeal* Break me, daddy...<</speech>>
...

...

...

<<speech "You" "''$name'':">>
(How am I supposed to sleep like this...?)<</speech>>
You wait for them to finish, but although she keeps climaxing, the moaning doesn't seems to stop. You're too tired and finally drift off.
